Download
========

The current version of Requests is {{ site.github.latest_release.tag_name }}, which you can
download from GitHub as a
[zip]({{ site.github.latest_release.zipball_url }}) or a
[tarball]({{ site.github.latest_release.tarball_url }}).

You can also check out the [releases page][releases] on GitHub for a changelog
plus more information.

[releases]: {{ site.github.releases_url }}


Alternative Methods
-------------------

### Installing via Composer
If you're using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage
dependencies, you can add Requests with it.

```sh
composer require {{ site.requests.packagist }}
```

or
```json
{
    "require": {
        "{{ site.requests.packagist }}": "^{{ site.github.latest_release.tag_name | replace_first: 'v', '' }}"
    }
}
```

And if you don't do so already, make sure you load the Composer autoload file.

```php
require_once dirname(__FILE__) . '/vendor/autoload.php';
```


### Installing via Git
To install the source code:

```bash
$ git clone {{ site.github.clone_url }}
```

And include it in your scripts:

```php
require_once '/path/to/Requests/src/Autoload.php';
```

You'll probably also want to register an autoloader:

```php
WpOrg\Requests\Autoload::register();
```
